This is my first ever programming project. The language I am using is VBA, the programming language for Excel. 

The goal of this project is to provide an Excel sheet where you can store and manage your golf score, you have played on my homecourse.
The idea is, that on the first page you type in your, the course combination you have played (my course has 3x9 holes, thus six combination) and the date. When you click on the "GO!" button, the score will disappear and stored in the appropriate sheet. So if you have played the A+B course, for example, the score will be written in the A, B and A+B sheet.

In each of this "Course Sheets" you will find a typical scorecard with your average hole scores in the top row. Furthermore it shows you your all time result to par. 
The table next to the scorecard ranks the holes according to the scores you played on the certain holes. The hole where you need the most strokes over par on average will get the position one (the most difficult hole).
The most right table plus chart display how your rounds are made up. It shows you the percentage of eagles, birdies, pars, bogeys and worse.

You can easily adapt this sheets to your home course by changing the par values. But do not rename the worksheets or any cell.

Hopefully this file makes it easier for you to take care of your scores and keep in mind that this is my first try to "programm" something while reading my code ;)
