This is my first ever programming project. The language I am using is VBA, the programming language for Excel. 

The goal of this project is to provide an Excel sheet where you can store and manage your golf score, you have played on my homecourse.
The idea is, that on the first page you type in your, the course combination you have played (my course has 3x9 holes, thus six combination) and the date. When you click on the "GO!" button, the score will disappear and stored in the appropriate sheet. So if you have played the A+B course, for example, the score will be written in the A, B and A+B sheet.

In each of this "Course Sheets" you will find a scorecard
